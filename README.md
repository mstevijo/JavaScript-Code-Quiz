JavaScript Code Quiz 

In week 4 of this bootcamp program we were asked to develope a multiple choice code quiz! Not only were we to use JavaScript but also dynamic HTML. We were to have a working timer that both adds and subtracts time with right and wrong answers. 

Here in my code quiz you will find that once you beging with the call to action, by start the quiz using the Start button the time will start ticking away on the timer, and the first question will appear on the screen. As you answer the 3 multiple choice questions by clicking directly on the box of the answer you wish to chose, you will either loose 10 seconds of time for a wrong answer, or you will gain up to 10 seconds of time for a correct answer toping at 75 seconds. 

Have fun playing and try to get the perfect score of 75!

This is a work in progess that will soon have High Score feature and more!
